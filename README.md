Road Informer
Introduction:
Different types of online resources aren't good enough to give us enough
information about long distance road. For distance travel most of our people
use Buses. But they may don’t know which buses to ride to reach the
destination, they don’t know other choices of transports like train, local plane
and so on, cost of travelling using those transports. Besides there may be
different path of different distance, and path having shorter distance may
take more time because of traffic. The sole purpose of our app is to provide
this type of information ( like different transports, their costs, different ways ,
shortest distances, shortest times ) to our user and help them to choose a
best selection from many available option.

activities in the transportation sector of Bangladesh but will be open to all

people including foreigners who need extreme help to find out a suitable way

make connection between the anonymous users and specified registered
users. Specified registered users will get the great opportunity to come in
close contact of their job related anonymous users and can increase the
popularity of their companies which will render a great service in economical
